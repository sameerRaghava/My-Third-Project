# My-Third-Project
Sales Performance Analysis &amp; Forecasting 
In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to perform end-to-end data analysis on a sales dataset. The workflow included data cleaning, formula-driven transformations, pivot table creation, and dashboard visualizations. The final outcome is an interactive and insightful Excel dashboard that highlights sales performance by region, product category, and customer type. This project demonstrates strong analytical thinking and proficiency in Excelâ€™s data tools, valuable for quick insights in business contexts.
